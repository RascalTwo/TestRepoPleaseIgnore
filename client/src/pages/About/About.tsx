      <p>
        We know how important water is for our overall health, and with the
        daily comings and goings of life, we don't consume as much water as we
        should on a daily basis. Our app aims to make such an important aspect
        of our daily life as easy as possible with this app. Whether you're on
        the go, on vacation, or at home vibing, you are able to track your
        fluids and water. At the end of the day, you will have a clear and easy
        way of knowing that you are consuming the right amount of fluids each
        day in one place.
